## 1. Creating an Issue

To create an issue:

When you create a new issue in the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/thinking-grp/thinkerAI/issues), a template will be displayed for you to fill in.

The two most important pieces of information needed to evaluate an issue are a **description of the problem** and a **simple test case** that reproduces the issue. If it can be reproduced, it is easier to fix.

Unresolved issues may involve discussions. If this is the case, please participate in the discussion and help resolve the issue.

## 3. Resolving the Issue

Most issues are resolved by the thinkerAI development team. However, some issues may be closed without being resolved.

Examples of issues that may be closed include:

* Duplicate issues
* Issues that have already been resolved
* Issues occurring in old versions
